                    <ul>The layout is our first step in designing your kitchen. 
                        <li class="listStyle">We make sure your sink, cabinets, and appliances placement are right for you.</li>
                        <li class="listStyle">We consider all your needs: reduce traffic, comfortable distance between appliances and other main fixtures like your stove to kitchen and stove to sink.</li>
                        <li class="listStyle">We'll rework the floor plan until you're fully satisfied</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="title-3">Choice</h2>
                    <p>We make your life easy by helping you match the kitchen countertops, cabinets, appliances, flooring, and paint color options. You get to choose the cabinets, countertop, appliances, tiling, sink, and faucet selection from any retailer.  </p>

                    <h3 class="title-3">Budget</h3>
                    <p>The homeowner's input is important to the kitchen renovation cost. We work with you to determine a budget, and then we create a timeless design to fit that budget. Additionally, our customers have 100% control of where the products installed in your new kitchen are purchased. This allows us to give you the most choices and eliminate unnecessary costs. Whether you're doing a major renovation or designing the perfect kitchen, your project, big or small, needs to leave you satisfied.</p>
